# TransferHero

TransferHero is a tool I wrote to help me find a community college that was offering Data Structures over the Summer.  Without it I may have had to wait another semester to transfer.

### What I learned

- Used Selenium to automate actions for a website that can't easily be parsed using simple requests due to literally everything being a div thanks to ng-bootstrap.
